# Sorting Hat

This project was to make a form that creates cards which prints data captured by an input field and a house randomizer. The cards also have buttons to remove them. I practiced using boostrap to style the page.

## How to run this project
* Use npm to install http-server in your terminal:
```sh
npm install -g http-server
```
* Run the server
```sh
hs -p 9999
```
* Open chrome and navigate to:
```
localhost:9999
```
